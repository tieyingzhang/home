I am a research scientist and manager at Bytedance US lab. Before joining Bytedance, I was a research scientist and manager at Alibaba DAMO Academy. Before that I was a postdoc in the [Computer Science Department (Database Group)](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and [Anthony Tomasic](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tomasic/), on AI-powered database systems. Prior to coming to CMU, I was an assistant professor at Chinese Academy of Sciences. My areas of research are AI for Systems and Systems for AI.

- I am working on ByteBrain, which is the AI for Infra (AI for System) platform of Bytedance.

- My open source project [Domino](https://github.com/domino-succ/domino/wiki) becomes the core component of HP's DBMS [Trafodion](https://attic.apache.org/projects/trafodion.html) (now Attic). Domino is a transaction processing engine, that utilizes HBase's multi-version to handle distributed transactions.
